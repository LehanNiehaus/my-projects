During the December holidays 2020, I suddenly got interested in fractals,
so I challenged myself to make the mandelbrot set with minimal help from the internet.
After geting it to work, I made it show a cool julia set fractal.

click on a part of the fractal, wait a few seconds and it will zoom in 2x where you clicked.

I used the P5.js library to make this.

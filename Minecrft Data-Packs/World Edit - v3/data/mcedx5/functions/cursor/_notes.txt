run() shows cursor and returns xyz location of the cursor on cursor(#x,#y,#z) and gPort(#x,#y,#z)
profile_load() takes what ever is on #profile and aplies it to the scoreboard. leaves #color unchanged if not provided. Also "repairs" #profile.
profile_save() the inverse of load_profile(). aplies what is on the scoreboard to #profile, including the color.
	To remove the color, do /scoreboard players operation #profile cursor %= #10^5 cursor

scoreboard:	cursor:
		#color [1;16] (subject to change)
		#dist (1 = 0.1 blocks)
		#fixed:
			0 = ray-cast
			1 = fixed (ray-cast ignore)
		#p-block (pre-block) boolean
		position xyz (output) on gPort
		#profile: profile to be used, if loaded
			color(optional):fixed:p-block:dist
			00:0:0:000
			color 00 will leave #color untouched
		#x, #y, #z: position of the cursor

		player [profiles]: the profile the player uses

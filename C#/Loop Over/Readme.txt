Loop-Over is one of my first games and programing projects I ever made. I made it way back in 2018, when i just started to learn c#.
Looking back at it now, I think,
"HOW ON EARTH did I know what was going on in there!?"
"Did I sereosly only use ONLY global variables?"
But hey, we need to start somewhere and I am still proud of it.

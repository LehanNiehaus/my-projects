This was another steppingstone for me to learn c#.
I followed a tutorial by TheCodingTrain on neaural networks. He did it in javascript,
but for some reason i wanted to use c#, Most of my C# knowledge and experience comes from this.
I unfortunately got burnt out on this project and left it in 2019. It is still incomlete, but feel free to look at it.
I might come back to it some day.
